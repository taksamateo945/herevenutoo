The Golden Scarab is located in Caelid’s Abandoned Cave, a well-hidden location filled with rivers of scarlet rot that is accompanied by a boss battle with two adversaries known as the Cleanrot Knights. Below, we’ll go into more depth about the Abandoned Cave, the Golden Scarab talisman, and how to defeat the Cleanrot Knights.</p><h3>GOLDEN SCARAB LOCATION</h3><h3>How to get the Golden Scarab talisman in Elden Ring</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/6pg5fw5hzuZNpvGjMtsLjc-970-80.jpg.png alt width=970 height=546 sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Players in Elden Ring need travel to Caelid, which lies to the east of the beginning Limgrave, in order to obtain the Golden Scarab talisman and improve their Runes. They are specifically searching for the Abandoned Cave, as its name suggests. This can be discovered past the dead trees inhabited by a pair of mangy monster dogs, east of the Smouldering Wall Site of Grace. We have a walkthrough for the actual Abandoned Cave as well as instructions on how to defeat the Cleanrot Knights boss battle.</p><h3>Where to find the Elden Ring Golden Scarab</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/EbhdpeKev4Ro8ourLj7ptd-970-80.jpg.png alt width=970 height=546 sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>There will be a ravine on the opposite side of this location that blocks off your path, but a giant branch crosses it and enters the opposite cliffside, leading to an open cavern (seen above). The abandoned cave is there, but use great care as you cross the branch. It has a horrible propensity of making you slide off the edge to your death (it’s a long drop) if you step anywhere other than the absolute centre.</p><p>The difficulties don’t stop once you’re inside. Use the Site of Grace, and be sure to stock up on Preserving Boluses and other Scarlet Rot-curing items. Some poison remedies wouldn’t hurt either, but if you’re careful, they won’t be quite as necessary.</p><h3>ABANDONED CAVE WALKTHROUGH</h3><h3>Abandoned Cave walkthrough</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Zgvo5cvsk3ACDdYBpdENdd-970-80.jpg.png alt width=970 height=546 sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>The reward for defeating a few bosses in the Abandoned Cave mini-dungeon is the Elden Ring Golden Scarab, which is located at the extreme end of the area. However, the Cave itself is somewhat difficult, therefore we have created this step-by-step guide to navigating it.</p><p>You can see a scarlet river of ooze running down the ledge from the Site of Grace; it is pure Scarlet Rot. Your Rot metre will increase by standing in it, and if it reaches its maximum value, you will develop Scarlet Rot. Your health gradually depletes as a result of this illness, which can only be treated by items, magic, or resting at a Site of Grace. Additionally, the waist-high muck slows you down, which might be deadly in some situations.<br>Additionally, you’ll notice bubbling geysers that occasionally erupt; standing in them causes damage even while they’re just bubbling, and if you’re there when it explodes, you’ll take a lot of damage that could kill you.<br>In light of this, you should leave the Site of Grace. When the geyser has just erupted, take advantage of the widest window of opportunity to jump into the river by standing on the ledge and doing so. When it does, run through the bubbles while hugging the wall and make a beeline for the enormous Iron Maiden that is positioned directly across from you and is perched on a small island above the Rot (don’t worry, the Maiden is inactive).<br>Now, you have two options for travel. The one on the right leads nowhere and demands Dragonwound Grease (if you want to brave the Geyser blocking it). The one on the left leads you further into the cave.<br>You’ll find a thankfully dry trail with a Martyr Effigy halfway down if you take the left path. Ideally, you should ignite your lantern right now.<br>A bigger cavern with another ledge and more Geysers of Scarlet Rot below can be reached by continuing down the trail. The Serpent Bow is an item that can be found in the midst of the Geysers, but you are not required to take it if you don’t feel bold enough.<br>Before descending, go to the far right side of the ledge and kill the fungus wizard there before he can shoot poison projectiles at you if all you want to do is survive. To return to dry ground, keep going right (or south) through the tunnel.<br>The cave is now slightly more accessible. Rats and another fungus mage up ahead will poison you, but there is an alcove on the right side where you can hide before moving forward to kill him.<br>After cutting up the piece of shiitake, proceed past him into a more compact space where there are a few rats and a body with Fire Grease on it. Before entering the cavern up ahead, pause for a moment and then continue down the tunnel.<br>There are several dangers in the cavern itself, including fungal wizards firing at you, pools of Scarlet Rot, and the enormous poison-firing flower monsters you may have encountered on your excursions. If you feel unprepared, we advise avoiding all of these activities. Instead, run up the slope to where two of the fungus mages are and hug the right side of the wall. Kill them if you like, then hide behind them in the Northern tunnel.<br>To grab the Venomous Fang, a rare weapon, you can return to this large area at any moment if you’re feeling particularly courageous. However, to get to the Golden Scarab, you must follow that northern tunnel.<br>The golden fog that designates a boss arena is at the end of this tunnel. Have your Rot cures and flasks available, along with gear appropriate for close-quarters combat, before you enter the room. Mages won’t fare well in this conflict.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ube30492287fe3411ee604b382e4b763e><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Simplified : How To Get Every Single Boltdrake Talisman In Elden Ring</span></a><h3>CLEANROT KNIGHTS BOSS FIGHT</h3><h3>How to beat the Cleanrot Knights (Spear and Sickle) boss fight</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/83UXEg69suDf58XHNrnq5d-970-80.jpg.png alt width=970 height=546 sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Anyone who has made it past Godrick should be able to manage the Cleanrot Knights with relative ease for anyone who has reached Leyndell or beyond. Even those who have passed that point still need to exercise caution because they are well-equipped to take advantage of player complacency. Anyone before that point may find them difficult.</p><p>The Scarlet Rot River flows through the arena of the Cleanrot Knights. The last thing any player wants is to lose health throughout a fight, so you need to take note of where this river is and do all in your power to avoid stepping in it once the combat begins.<br>When the battle begins, there will just be the Spear Knight in front of you, rising from his kneeling position. If you move quickly enough, you can get behind them and do a backstab before the actual fight starts.<br>Both knights have the ability to deflect blows by crossing their swords in front of them, and they can also turn a deflection into a painful shove that pushes players back who are trying to break through. When you notice someone doing this, give them room until they relax their guard.<br>The Spear Knight loses nearly half of his health before the Sickle Knight enters the arena. Both have advantages over one another; the Sickle Knight launches ranged discs and performs wider, sweeping strikes, while the Spear Knight charges in for close-quarters jabs.<br>The Spear Knight should always be defeated first, no matter what. They’ll already be more damaged, and since they’re trying to attack the person close by, you’ll have to deal with them more frequently. In order to avoid being caught off guard by any projectile strikes, try to deal as much damage to them as you can before the Sickle Knight enters the fray. You should also utilise their thrust attacks as an opportunity to sneak up behind them.<br>The second Cleanrot is considerably easier to control once the Spear Knight is killed. The Spear Knight performs broad, sweeping melee attacks with highly obvious wind-ups, making them simple to avoid. His magic projectile discs also break through shields easily, although they may be avoided by simply rolling away from where he launched them.<br>You will receive 7000 Runes if you defeat the two Cleanrot Knights, but you will actually receive much more than that because they also drop the priceless Golden Scarab.</p><h3>GOLDEN SCARAB RUNE BOOST</h3><h3>How to use the Golden Scarab to boost Runes</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/kRkzAeb2BN56YwppzgWzTd-970-80.jpg.png alt width=970 height=546 sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>You can put on the Golden Scarab Talisman from the equipment menu. We found that while worn, it increases Runes obtained from defeating foes by roughly 17–20%. (though not through using Rune items or selling gear to merchants). For an even bigger boost, it stacks with the Gold-Pickled Fowl Foot.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ued3d637dad13b14c7c459e99100c3d78><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Easiest Way To Find The Mask Of Confidence In Elden Ring</span></a><p>In any case, this is a huge problem because the Elden Ring’s Runes are its most crucial component for progression, and the longer you wear it, the faster it will advance you through the game. We advise that once you get it, you pin it to your character’s lapel and never, ever remove it. If you visit one of our Elden Ring Rune farming areas, it will undoubtedly perform wonders, making the trip even more fruitful.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.

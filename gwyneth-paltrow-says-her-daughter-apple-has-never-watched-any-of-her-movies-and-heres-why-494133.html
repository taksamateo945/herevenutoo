However, it turns out that her own daughter is yet to watch even one movie with her in it and here’s why!</p><p>It sounds like, while other people associate the actress with certain roles she’s been in, her daughter, Apple only sees her as her mom and nothing else!</p><p>That’s partially because she has never seen any of Gwyneth’s movies and while on the premiere episode of Shop TODAY with Jill Martin, the Hollywood celeb explained why that is.</p><p>She started by saying that ‘My kids have never seen me in a movie,’ before correcting herself: ‘I mean, I think that my son has seen the Iron Man things, but I do not think my daughter has ever seen me in a movie.’</p><p>Paltrow went on to explain why Apple hasn’t seen any of her productions.</p><p>According to the mom of two, she ‘thinks it’s weird if I’m onscreen.

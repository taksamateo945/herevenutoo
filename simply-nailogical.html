And, J-14 magazine describes her as “the face of nail art in the internet world”. Likewise, she launched her Simply Nailogical blog in February 2014. And, prior to making videos, she shared pictures of her nail art on the blog and on Instagram for nearly a year before being requested to create longer videos on youtube.

Likewise, in June 2016, Rotenberg shared a video of herself applying over 100 coats of nail polish titled “100+ Coats of Nail Polish #POLISHMOUNTAIN”.

And, included in the same set were the polishes “Hustler” and “Adventure Capitalist”.</p><p>In July 2019, Cristine created her own nail polish line called Holo Taco. The brand’s name comes from her habit of calling nail polish top coats “tacos” in her YouTube videos. She started brainstorming for the business in the year 2017 and began prototyping polishes in the year 2018. Likewise, the original Holo Taco launch contained two opaque polishes (“one coat black” and “royal-tea blue”) in addition to three holographic topcoats. Surprisingly, the collection sold out within two hours.</p><p>Furthermore, Cristine Rotenberg owns the other two Youtube channels, SimplyPodLogical Highlights, and Holo Taco.

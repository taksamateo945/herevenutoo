I know we are literally having lunch together rn but it needed to be said here too</strong></p><p>If it was just Anthony who posted on his Instagram, maybe fans wouldn't make this a controversy but maybe they also saw the recent post of Harley Quinn where she wished all the best to the actor Keyvan. But in the caption, she also mentioned that she was his best friend and she only wishes the best for him. The Instagram post <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned</a>,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade" dir=auto><strong>my very best f*****g friend has a show out today and I am soooooo proud of his cutie ass üò©üò©üò©‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòªüòª go watch <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=# rel=noopener>@xokittynetflix</a>&nbsp;streaming now!!!!!! üò±üò±üò±‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•</strong></p><p>So, we can safely assume that Anthony doesn't seem to be in a romantic relationship with Harley and they are just best friends who are close but in the entertainment industry people of opposite genders can't be friends according to fans.

Does He Have a Boyfriend?</h3><p>The rumor about <strong>Anthony Keyvan</strong>'s sexuality has again resurfaced with the release of the series, XO, Kitty. It's not the first time the actor has been in the spotlight and the fans have been curious about his sexuality. The Internet has been wanting to know this answer for a while now.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Despite the fact that television shows like Love, Victor features a variety of LGBTQ+ characters, the public is still uninformed of Anthony Keyvan's sexual orientation.

The 22-year-old actor has never revealed anyone he has dated till now maybe that's one of the reasons why people think he is gay and he is having a hard time coming out of the closet.</p><p>Anthony also had sympathy for queer persons who had to deal with taboos and difficulties in Muslim societies. It is essential to respect Anthony Keyvan's boundaries and refrain from assuming anything about his sexuality given the scant information that is currently available and his decision to keep his sexual orientation private.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FFqKmtrZ6ae6S7zGiYp6yYpLu6ecqesK%2BZnmK0qr7Ln6minZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

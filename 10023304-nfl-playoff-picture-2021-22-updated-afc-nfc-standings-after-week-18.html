That would have meant the <i>Sunday Night Football</i> clash between the Los Angeles Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders would be for the last playoff spot in the conference.</p><p>Jacksonville clearly missed the memo with a stunning win.</p><p>As for the NFC, the Green Bay Packers already clinched the No. 1 seed and the first-round bye before Week 18. However, the biggest pressure point came in the wild-card race, as the San Francisco 49ers would clinch a spot with a win over the Los Angeles Rams.</p><p>If they lost, the New Orleans Saints would steal it with a victory over the Atlanta Falcons. However, the 49ers came away with an overtime win.</p><p>The Las Vegas Raiders then clinched a spot with a dramatic overtime win over the Los Angeles Chargers.</p><p>Here is a look at the standings after Sunday's games.</p><p>1. Tennessee Titans, 12-5 (clinched No. 1 seed)</p><p>2.&nbsp;Kansas City Chiefs, 12-5 (clinched playoffs)</p><p>3. Buffalo Bills, 11-6 (clinched playoffs)</p><p>4.&nbsp;Cincinnati Bengals, 10-7 (clinched playoffs)</p><p>5.&nbsp;Las Vegas Raiders, 10-7&nbsp;(clinched playoffs)</p><p>6. New England Patriots, 10-7 (clinched playoffs)</p><p>7.&nbsp;Pittsburgh Steelers, 9-7-1&nbsp;(clinched playoffs)</p><p>8. Indianapolis Colts, 9-8 (eliminated)</p><p>9. Miami Dolphins, 9-8 (eliminated)</p><p>10. Los Angeles Chargers, 9-8&nbsp;(eliminated)</p><p>11. Cleveland Browns, 8-9 (eliminated)</p><p>12.&nbsp;Baltimore Ravens, 8-9 (eliminated)</p><p>13. Denver Broncos, 7-10 (eliminated)</p><p>14. New York Jets, 4-13 (eliminated)</p><p>15. Houston Texans, 4-13 (eliminated)</p><p>16. Jacksonville Jaguars, 3-14 (eliminated)</p><p>1. Green Bay Packers, 13-4 (clinched No. 1 seed)</p><p>2. Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 13-4 (clinched playoffs)</p><p>3.&nbsp;Dallas Cowboys, 12-5 (clinched playoffs)</p><p>4.&nbsp;Los Angeles Rams, 12-5 (clinched playoffs)</p><p>5. Arizona Cardinals, 11-6 (clinched playoffs)</p><p>6. San Francisco 49ers, 10-7&nbsp;(clinched playoffs)</p><p>7. Philadelphia Eagles, 9-8 (clinched playoffs)</p><p>8. New Orleans Saints, 9-8 (eliminated)</p><p>9. Minnesota Vikings, 8-9 (eliminated)</p><p>10.&nbsp;Washington Football Team, 7-10 (eliminated)</p><p>11. Seattle Seahawks, 7-10 (eliminated)</p><p>12.&nbsp;Atlanta Falcons, 7-10 (eliminated)</p><p>13. Chicago Bears, 6-11 (eliminated)</p><p>14. Carolina Panthers, 5-12 (eliminated)</p><p>15. New York Giants, 4-13 (eliminated)</p><p>16. Detroit Lions, 3-13-1 (eliminated)</p><p>The roller coaster of a season for the Colts took another dramatic turn Sunday.</p><p>Indianapolis went from 1-4 and looking well on its way to a lost season, then to 9-6 and looking like an AFC contender and finally finishing 9-8 with a stunning loss to the Jaguars. All it had to do in order to reach the playoffs without having to worry about other results was to win one of its last two games against the Raiders and Jaguars, but it lost both.</p><p>Perhaps the only thing more shocking than Jacksonville's win is how easy it came.</p><p>Carson Wentz threw an interception and didn't even get the Colts offense into the end zone until the fourth quarter when the visitors were trailing by 23 points. The defense also struggled to contain rookie Trevor Lawrence, who threw for 223 yards and two touchdowns without a pick.</p><p>That kept the Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens alive, and the two AFC North rivals fittingly went into overtime with so much at stake.</p><p>Ben Roethlisberger delivered in perhaps the final regular-season game of his career by hitting&nbsp;Ray-Ray McCloud for a key fourth-down conversion to set up the winning field goal for&nbsp;Chris Boswell.</p><p>Not only did the field goal eliminate the Ravens, but it also eliminated the Colts.</p><p>All the wild-card contenders were left looking up at the Titans, who clinched the No. 1 seed with a narrow 28-25 win over the Texans. Tennessee looked to be in cruise control with a 21-0 advantage at halftime, but Houston almost did Patrick Mahomes a big favor with a late comeback.</p><p>It turns out the thrilling set of first games was just a sign of what was to come.</p><p>San Francisco clinched its playoff spot with a 27-24 overtime victory over the Rams. It overcame a 14-point halftime deficit, scored a touchdown with 26 seconds remaining in regulation to force overtime and then finished the win with an Ambry Thomas interception after Robbie Gould's field goal.</p><p>That eliminated the Saints, although it wasn't all bad news for the Rams.</p><p>They still won the NFC West because of the Seattle Seahawks' upset of the Arizona Cardinals. While the division will send three teams to the postseason, it ended up being the last-place Seahawks that decided first place.</p><p>The final game of the day featured arguably the most drama, with the Los Angeles Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders going down to the wire. Justin Herbert threw two touchdown passes in the final five minutes to come back from a 29-14 deficit.</p><p>It set up overtime in a situation where a tie would have sent both teams to the playoffs, but the Raiders kept playing for the win and got it on a last-second field goal.</p><p>Las Vegas clinched a playoff spot while Pittsburgh got the final seed in the AFC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloYmiAcYCMp52lZaChrrq7xZ9kqaGTqcKzsYxrZ2tpXWd%2FbsHPnZitnZRirqevjKednGWjqa6vsMinnqxlkZvBpr6MsJyeo11mhQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

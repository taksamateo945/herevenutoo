Per Brandon Jenkins of 247Sports, "the expectation is for Quaintance to follow Calipari to Fayetteville and commit to the Razorbacks."</p><p>Quaintance initially committed to UK last November and said that Calipari's influence played a key factor.</p><p>"They've had guard success, but they've had good success with bigs, a lot more than other colleges. Coach (John) Calipari has been showing a lot of love, and Coach Chin (Coleman), too," Quaintance told On3's <a href=# rel=noopener>Joe Tipton</a>. "Coach Cal has already come to Word of God twice to see me. We've been able to build a good relationship."</p><p>The Tigers could certainly be in play again, but it won't be a shock whatsoever to see Quaintance follow Coach Cal to Arkansas, especially given his previous comments.</p><p>Quaintance is a 6'9", 230-pound center who played ball at Word Of God Christian Academy in Raleigh, North Carolina. He reclassified from the class of 2025 and doesn't turn 18 until July 2025.</p><p>In other words, he'll need to play two years post-high school before heading to the pros, so the potentially NBA-bound star could be a huge addition for any program that lands him given that he could be around for two seasons instead of perhaps just one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWuAdn6Mq5ypp6KpenZ50q2Yq2WTYreixcOepWappZa2r8DAp5qeZZSasLC5zKKrrGWWp7yuecqepa2tk6DGbq3FrZyrZZqkta95wpqjoqiRp7a0ecSxoK0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

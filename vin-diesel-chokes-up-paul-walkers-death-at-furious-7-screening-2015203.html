"As you know this was a very personal and important film to us, every time when I saw the movie at the premiere, Paul Walker and I would go off to the side, and he would always tell me, 'Vin, the best one's still in the can,'" he continued.</p><p>After telling viewers to be mindful of the fact that others have to wait a little to see the film (which hits theaters on Friday, April 3), so to keep the story line quiet, the actor's mood became somber.</p><p>"This was a labor of love," he said. "It was in some ways the hardest movie that I ever had to do because the relationships that you see on film are so real, when the tragedy happened, I lost my best friend, I lost my brother."</p><p>Overwhelmed by emotion, Diesel paused. "Tonight…" he said, before struggling to compose himself.</p><p></p><p>"You've got family here Vin," one audience member shouted out, cheering the actor.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I love that, thanks for being my family, thanks for always taking care of us, thanks for believing in us. You know what's most important in life. This is our gift to you, but more importantly, it's for my brother there," he added.</p><p>Walker died in November 2013 after a car he was riding in crashed and burst into flames in Southern California. He was 40 years old.</p><p>Watch Vin's emotional tribute on the video above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaK2ipl2Ztqa%2FxKVknKCfoLK0edSpZKmZpaF6uK3LpJyrq12ZsqLAx2aYrWWWqr%2Bqu9SsZHBlo5i%2FprHNoqWgZWJlfnZ%2Bj2w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

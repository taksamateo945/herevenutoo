The gaming platform is famed for allowing players to win huge jackpot prizes and producing many lucky millionaires. Powerball in South Africa has continued to put smiles on people’s faces, with lots of them cashing out an outrageous sum of money.</p><p>If you are interested in playing Powerball, we have listed all the facts you need to know before putting in your money. This article also contains various ways you can comfortably play the lottery game and more.</p><h2><strong>How Powerball Began In South Africa</strong></h2><p>Powerball first started in America on April 2, 1992, when it replaced Lotto America. It is present in countries like Australia, South Africa, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. The South Africa Powerball was launched on October 23, 2009. Since then, it has risen to become the most popular lottery in South Africa due to its rollovers and consequent huge payouts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/pp3-e1635433236335.png><p>Every week, tens of thousands of South Africans cash out from Powerball and the supplementary game Powerball Plus, which was introduced on November 28, 2015. Powerball is organized by ITHUBA Holdings (RF) Proprietary Limited, which got the license to organize the lottery on June 1, 2015. Earlier, it was being organized by the national lottery operator Gidani consortium.</p><p>The biggest Powerball jackpot record was set on February 19, 2019, when a man in his fifties from Capetown matched all five main numbers and the Powerball to win R232 million after 24 rollovers. The highest win so far in 2021 is R158 million, which was won using R15. The winner from North West used an Absa banking app to buy his ticket.&nbsp;To be eligible to play Powerball South Africa, you must be 18 years and above. However, you mustn’t reside in South Africa.</p><h2><strong>How to Play Powerball In South Africa</strong></h2><p>Although the chances of winning a lottery can be very slim, there is no denying that a substantial number of people have had their lives changed for the better through lottery wins.&nbsp;Playing the lottery is like any other risk-taking adventure, with the probability of wins and losses; the crux of the matter is to be deliberate about how much to bet, what numbers to bet on, studying patterns, and of course, luck.</p><p>Powerball is one out of many lotteries with high chances of getting a win. The odds of getting a win in Powerball is one in thirty-five. As Powerball South Africa is becoming increasingly popular, let’s look at what the buzz is all about.</p><h2><strong>How Does Powerball Work and How Much Is A Powerball Ticket?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Players have to choose five main numbers from 1 to 50 along with an additional Powerball number from 1 to 20. In total, there should be six numbers selected. If the Powerball number and one or more of the main numbers chosen are drawn for the day the player indicated, the player wins a prize.</p><p><strong>The prize divisions are:</strong></p><ul><li>9th prize division for matching just the Powerball (R10)</li><li>8th prize division for matching a number plus the Powerball (R15)</li><li>7th prize division for matching two numbers plus the Powerball (3.9 of the prize pool)</li><li>6th prize division for matching three numbers (5.19% of the prize pool)</li><li>5th prize division for matching three numbers plus the Powerball (6.23% of the prize pool)</li><li>4th prize division for matching four numbers (5.51% of the prize pool)</li><li>3rd prize division for matching four numbers plus the Powerball (3.25% of the prize pool)</li><li>2nd prize division for matching five numbers (5.19% of the prize pool)</li><li>Ist prize division for matching five numbers plus the Powerball (70.73% of the prize pool)</li></ul><p>The first prize division is the Jackpot, where a player matches all numbers drawn in the lottery. The prizes for the eighth and ninth divisions are fixed at R15 and R10, respectively. After the fixed prizes are paid from 50% of total ticket sales, the remaining prize pool is shared amongst the other divisions at a fixed percentage. That means the prizes to be won for each division are constantly changing depending on the volume of tickets sold.</p><p>In addition, if the jackpot prize isn’t won for a draw, the prize is rolled over to the next draw, increasing the prize money. Powerball jackpots keep rolling over until there is a winner or multiple winners. Of course, the total prize money for each division is divided by the number of players in each division that won in that lottery draw.</p><p>A Powerball ticket costs R5 per board, with the supplementary Powerball Plus costing an additional R2.5. That means that to play the Powerball Plus, you must have purchased the Powerball ticket. The Powerball Plus increases the chance of winning, though the prizes are smaller.</p><h2><strong>Can You Play Powerball Online and How Do You Play on Your Phone?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>There are many options available to purchase and play Powerball. Included in these options are online options you can access with just your phone. Whatsmore, with these online options, you don’t have to worry about losing your ticket, and there is no chance you will forget to check if you win any prize because your online platform will notify you in case of a win.

Tickets can be purchased between 6 am and 11 pm SAST on non-draw days, but sales close at 8:30 on Tuesdays and Fridays – 30 minutes before the draw takes place.</p><h2><strong>How Many Numbers Are In Powerball?</strong></h2><p>There are six numbers in Powerball; five main numbers (chosen from 1-50) and one Powerball number (selected from 1-20).</p><h2><strong>How Many Numbers Do You Need To Win?</strong></h2><p>Matching with just one number is enough for a win in Powerball. However, this number must be the Powerball. Matching the Powerball plus any main numbers increases the prize money.</p><h3><strong>Winning Tips To Help With Playing Powerball</strong></h3><li>Play smart. Although buying more tickets increases your chances of winning, it doesn’t guarantee you will win. In essence, use the money you don’t need to play and be disciplined.</li><li>Pick your numbers. It is better to pick your numbers yourself instead of using a quick pick. Not only are some numbers special, but there might also be your lucky number.</li><li>When picking numbers, keep in mind the hot numbers and the cold numbers. Hot numbers appear more frequently than cold numbers. The possibility that they might recur is pretty high.</li><li>Always check your tickets. Many players have missed out on their winnings just because they failed to check their tickets or were careless in checking them. Playing via online platforms reduces this as you would get a notification if you do win.</li><li>Mix different size numbers. Every lottery has two halves of numbers – the low and the high. For Powerball, the low is 1-25, and the high is 26-50. So when choosing the number, pick numbers from both ranges. 70% of winning numbers are a combination of the high and the low numbers.</li><li>Sum up your numbers. The sum of all numbers picked should fall between 110 and 180. About 70 % of all lottery jackpots won had the sum in this range.</li><li>Avoid Picking the Same Numbers as Previous Winners. The possibility of winning with the same number as previous winners are pretty low.</li><li>Stick to your numbers. Sometimes sticking to one particular set of numbers might pay off in the long run.</li><li>Form syndicates, where you can pull money together as a group and purchase sufficient entries to guarantee the possibility of a huge win.</li><li>Avoid using birthdays, anniversaries numbers as this limits your choices. You can’t choose a number above 31. Meanwhile, the range goes up to 50.</li><h2><strong>Does 2 Numbers in Powerball Win Anything In South Africa?</strong></h2><p>Yes, matching the Powerball and any main number gets you the fixed 8th prize division prize money of R15.</p><h2><strong>What Are Your Odds of Winning a Prize in Powerball?</strong></h2><p>The odds of winning a Jackpot in Powerball South Africa is 1 in 42,375,200. But don’t worry, the odds for winning different divisions are significantly less. The odds for a 2nd division prize is 1 in 2,230,274. While for 3rd and 4th division prizes, it is 1 in 188,334 and 1 in 9,912 respectively.</p><p>For 5th and 6th division prizes, it is 1 in 4,280 and 1 in 225. And for 7th and 8th division prizes, it is 1 in 299 and 1 in 57. The odds of winning the 9th division prize is 1 in 35.</p><h3><strong>How To Claim Prizes Won on Powerball</strong></h3><p>Where you claim your prize depends on the amount won and the method used to purchase the ticket. For tickets purchased from licensed retailers in stores with prize money of up to R2,000, you can walk into the store and claim your prize from the retailer.</p><p>Prizes from R2000 to R49,000 will be transferred electronically or via cheque in authorized payment centers.

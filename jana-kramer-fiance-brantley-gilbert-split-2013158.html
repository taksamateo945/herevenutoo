The country singer and One Tree Hill actress, 29, has called off her engagement to fiance <strong>Brantley Gilbert</strong> just seven months after accepting his proposal, a source confirms to <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>.</p><p>"Their schedules have gotten crazier," the source tells <strong>Us</strong>. "She's been touring and so has he. There has been no time to plan, and distance got the best of them."</p><p>Indeed, in an interview with <strong>Us</strong> earlier this summer, Kramer hinted that finding time with her fiance had gotten tougher since she left on tour with <a href=#><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a>. "Brantley and I…I'm either writing or he's in the studio, and we block those days [out to spend together], but then we fill them with work stuff," she explained.</p><p>"[Blake's wife, <a href=#><strong>Miranda Lambert</strong></a>] said, 'Make the days that you have together just your days…Like, don't do any work," Kramer told <strong>Us</strong> of the marriage advice she had gotten from the couple. "So I'm like, 'Oh wait, we started that; we just didn't actually commit to it.' And she's like, 'You have to have those days. You have to block those days and say, 'No management, no this, no working. Just you two. Because if not, you lose focus.'"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kramer and Gilbert — a fellow country singer known for No. 1 hits like "You Don't Know Her Like I Do" — met a little over year ago at the CMT Music Awards in June 2012. Seven months later, on Gilbert's 28th birthday, they got engaged at the historic Ryman Auditorium Theater.</p><p>Alas, the wedding plans have now been scrapped. Kramer actually hinted on Twitter that things were less than great on Wednesday, Aug. 14, but she didn't offer an explanation as to why. "I had a really s–tty day, but DES MOINES IOWA just really made me believe! Thanks for making my night and makin me smile!" she <a href=#>tweeted</a> to her 323,000 followers.</p><p>Gilbert would have been Kramer's third husband. The Entourage alum was married twice before, to <strong>Michael Gambino</strong> in 2004 and to <strong>Johnathon Schaech</strong> for a month in 2010.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGappFiuLOtzJ6pZp6ZlruksYybqZqmpKGyunnGoqObnaKperS8y6KrZmpgZoBygZc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

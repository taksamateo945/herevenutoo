Now anyone can watch the show through streaming service Stageit with the purchase of a $10 ticket <a href=#>available here</a>, and the proceeds of their ticket price will benefit a different charity each show, this time Face Forward L.A.</p><p>“I’ve done everything to building homes, to helping kids, to helping single moms who can’t afford things for their babies,” Cabrera explained. “<a href=#>Face Forward L.A.</a> is helping reconstruct [the faces of] battered and abused women – it’s a great cause. I try to spread the love across the board as far as trying to hit as many charities as I can!”&nbsp;</p><p>While the "On the Way Down" singer swears he doesn’t have a favorite performer at this Sunday's show, he does have a soft spot for his ex-girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Ashlee Simpson</strong></a>’s husband.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for Evan to finally put out his music,” he admitted. “I’m like a proud papa watching him come out and be so talented!”</p><p>Cabrera is such a fan of Ross’ music that the two have teamed up.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We actually have a song together on my album that’s coming out in the fall,” Cabrera said. “So we did finally get to collaborate together and we have a song called ‘One and Only’ that we wrote together.”</p><p>While the song hasn’t been released yet, you can get your fix of Ryan Cabrera with his <a href=#>Wake Up Beautiful EP</a> which is out now or by checking out his <a href=#>House on Fire music video</a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmymZ5isKKu0Z6pmmWYpMC1v4yloK%2Bhnpx6s7vOpmScp56YsrPAjJ%2Bcmqylp7K0ecSvmKdloqTAtHmRaWhuamhq</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

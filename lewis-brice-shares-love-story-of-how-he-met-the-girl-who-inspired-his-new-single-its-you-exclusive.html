Can you talk a little about that?</strong></p><p><b>Lewis Brice:</b> We wrote that song about two years ago and once we got done with it, we were like, ‘we’ve got to cut that song.’ It just had something special to it. Inspiration wise, I wrote it with my good buddy and producer Ben Simonetti and Niko Moon<strong>,</strong> and we all have our respective significant others so we were all kind of in the same boat whenever we wrote it. For me it’s my girl, Denelle, that’s my inspiration behind this song.&nbsp;When you write about true feelings it comes out pretty easy.”</p><p><strong>CSC: What was it like getting to shoot a music video with your girlfriend? Can you talk about the shooting day and the entire experience for “It’s You?”</strong></p><p><strong>LB:</strong> “We shot it in <a href=#>the middle of COVID</a> and a lot of options were kind of eliminated so we couldn’t do it a lot of different places. But I was like, ‘you know what, this video really makes it personal and it really focuses on her.’ Rather than it be a big elaborate scene with a lot of people I was like, ‘I just need a really cool location that looks nice and classy.’ So we went over to the Analog in the Hutton Hotel. We couldn’t have a lot of people in the room at once, so we literally just had my videographers and a makeup girl and me and her. Just about 4 or 5 people, it was really cool. She was a little nervous going into it so I was like, ‘Babe you’re gonna be perfect for it. You look beautiful.’ She got her hair all done up real good and she enjoyed it. It made it really easy for me to have her in it. It turned out exactly how I wanted it to. I could’ve had a lot of people in it but the whole base of the song is wrapped around her. We broke it down to the last scenes of the video and it was literally just me and her. She looked absolutely stunning.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>CSC: You mentioned this song has received over 15 million streams so far. What do you think it is about “It’s You” that fans are so drawn to?</strong></p><p><strong>LB:</strong> “Well, I honestly think it’s because it’s a really cool and catchy song with the melody. And the song itself is just such an honest song. I’ve found the songs that I’ve released that are my most honest and true songs have really come across the audience a lot stronger and they seem to be drawn to it a lot more. It’s really singable and people can relate because they have that person in their life and a lot of times they want to show tribute to that person. That’s what it kind of was for me.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>CSC: The song was also co-produced by your brother Lee Brice? What’s it like getting to work on music as a family?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><strong>LB:</strong> “It’s really easy for us. He lets me do my thing. When I run things across him, he’s been in the business for so long, he’s so brilliant when it comes to music. I always love running ideas past him and he’ll kind of give us the go ahead or say, ‘man you should maybe do something a little more like this.’ But when it comes to preproduction we kind of talk about the music and it helps us wrap our heads around the best way to do these songs. He’s such an incredible artist and has such a great mind. Anytime we can bounce things off of him it’s a treat.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>CSC: Since the song is inspired by your girlfriend, can you share the story of how you met?</strong></p><p><strong>LB:</strong> “It was a few years ago and we’ve been together about four years now. I was out one night and she was working downtown at place we go to, Tin Roof, all the time. So I walked in to see one of my buddies playing and I went to the bar to get me a cold beverage so whenever I saw her she was absolutely gorgeous. I was like, ‘I might try to flirt with her a little bit’ so I flirted and got to the point where I wanted to buy her a drink while she was hanging out. She’s like, ‘Okay cool what do you want?’ And I said ‘Well whatever you want. I guess something kind of fruity or something like that.’ And she goes ‘Well no sir, I’m drinking Jack Daniels here.’ So she put Jack Daniels down and at the time that was definitely my drink of choice. So she stole my heart with a Jack Daniels.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/60ba4ca2-716e-4778-acfd-067b80574f6a-1024x833.png><p><strong>CSC: Do you have any other projects you’re currently working on or any new music coming out soon?</strong></p><p><strong>LB:</strong> “Yeah, we sure do. We’re in the studio right now working on it. We kind of go to different projects and we get a group of songs we think are good to go and transition back to back to back. I’ve been writing a lot this past year and had some really good songs come out of it. Then from there I was like, ‘You know what, since we burned through the last batch of songs we had, we are ready to move on to the next stage of music.’ Right now we have three in the studio that I’m singing vocals for so we’re looking at May or June for our next release.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>CSC: Now that shows are starting to pick back up, do you have any fun events coming up?</strong></p><p><strong>LB:</strong> “We’re starting to get a whole bunch of shows. I’ve got an acoustic tour planned for this summer. Pretty much the whole month of June and July we’ll be out in Indiana, Illinois, Delaware, Virginia and Boston. We have a whole tour planned out this summer. It’s an an all acoustic tour with my buddy. He just released an album a couple weeks ago and I was fortunate enough to get a couple cuts on the record. He knows my music and I know his so it will be a fun collaborative show.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>CSC: With the downtime we’ve all had over the past year, have you taken up any extra hobbies?</strong></p><p><strong>LB:</strong> “Honestly I’ve been doing a lot of writing. I’ve written more this year and last year than I have in years past because we have the time. I haven’t done a whole lot outside of my normal because I’m fortunate to be able to write my music. My girl actually took up painting a little bit and has paint classes. I might have dabbled with a little painting.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>CSC: Since we’re Celeb Secrets Country, can you share an interesting<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;fact about you that fans&nbsp;wouldn’t know&nbsp;just by hearing your music?</span></strong></p><p><strong>LB:</strong> “I love deep sea diving and I love going scuba diving. I’ve been down 150 feet under water one time and that was pretty awesome. I swam with a big old bull shark that I must have been about 25 feet from. That was pretty interesting. I’m definitely a water baby.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FEnKmerKOYvLa606uwZ5ufonxzfJFqZmlsX2Z%2BcLjEsKCsZZKntqSxjKyfmqqVqHqtu9WeZKysn6fGbrvFZp%2Bor12dsm65xK1kraCVYrSqvstmrqGnXZ67tLzIq5ydZZiewG66xLBkrKGenLmmecitqmaxn6p6psTCpaysoaaafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

However, Debbie is White by ethnicity.</p><p>She is the biological daughter of Betty Sue Palmer and Bob Palmer. Debbie was barely 23 when her parents’ marriage hit the rocks, and her mum, Betty, went into another marriage with Christopher Depp, who became her stepfather.</p><p>She has three siblings, Daniel Depp, Johnny Depp, and Christi Dembrowski – all Betty’s children but from different fathers. According to Christi Dembrowski, they passed through a troubled childhood as their mum Betty used to beat them repeatedly.</p><h3><strong>What Parent Does Debbie Depp Share with Johnny?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/03/292a1a8571b53d3b436e0fedb95c82d1-johnny-depp-sibling-e1679569870470.jpg><p>Debbie Depp and Johnny Depp are half-siblings as they share just one parent, Betty Sue Palmer. Johnny is a renowned Hollywood actor, movie producer, and musician with several roles to his credit. Betty also gave birth to Daniel Depp and Christi Dembrowski.</p><p>Christi works in a popular bar as a waitress, and Daniel Depp enjoys a multi-faceted career as a teacher, scriptwriter, published author, journalist, bookseller, and photographer.</p><p>Betty passed on at the age of 81 on May 26th, 2016. She didn’t leave a good memory for her children to cherish, and according to Johnny, his mum was the meanest human being he ever saw. Despite having a bad opinion of Betty, the Hollywood movie star still tattooed her name on his hand just for the sake of remembrance.</p><h3><strong>How Much Older than Johnny is Debbie Depp?</strong></h3><p>Going by the media reports, Debbie Depp is way older than her half-brother, as Johnny is seven years younger; he was born on the 9th of June 1963. However, the movie star’s fame robbed off on Debbie, and today, she is best recognized as Johnny Depp’s sister.</p><h2><strong>What Does Johnny Depp’s Sister Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Debby’s only claim to fame is having Johnny as a brother. She was involved in a mundane job in the education sector as a classroom teacher at the elementary level.</p><p>Her job as a tutor in a primary school offered Debbie the chance to live the kind of low-profile life she craves. However, having a brother as famous as Johnny Depp made it impossible. Fans of the actor have continued to express curiosity about her personal and professional life.</p><h2><strong>Is Debbie Depp Married?</strong></h2><p>Perhaps because Debbie Depp is not a mainstream celebrity, nothing much is known about her personal life. However, it is common knowledge that Johnny Depp’s half-sister is a married woman. Her husband has been identified as Richard Rassel. The duo first crossed paths at a doctor’s clinic before they commenced dating, which led to marriage. Nothing has been said about what Richard does for a living.</p><p>It is obvious that the couple has been married for decades. This is deduced from the ages of their children, who are all grown up with families of their own.</p><p>Born in 1980, Debbie’s son is a man who goes by the name Williams M Rassel. William earns a living as a recording engineer and has been married to Heather Rassel for several years.</p><p>Debbie Depp’s daughter is called Megan Rassel. Megan is equally married, but she lives a low-key life like her mum, which makes knowing anything about her personal and professional life difficult.</p><p>Debbie and her husband, Richard, still live in Lexington, Kentucky, where they raised their children.</p><h3><strong>Did Debbie Testify Against Johnny Depp During his Defamation Suit against Amber Heard?</strong></h3><p>Johnny Depp once filed a defamation lawsuit against his ex-spouse, Amber Heard, who initially claimed she was subject to domestic violence at his hands (always under the influence of hard substances) during their divorce hearing.</p><p>The couple, however, settled the domestic abuse case, where Amber received $7 million in compensation. In 2018, the movie star’s ex-wife wrote an op-ed for the media house, The Washington Post, with the caption “Amber Heard: I Spoke Up Against Sexual Violence — And Faced Our Culture’s Wrath”.</p><p>When the op-ed was published, Debbie Depp’s half-brother found it to have three defamatory statements, and in February 2019, he sued Amber for defamation.</p><p>When the case was called up in court, Jonny’e second sister, Christi Dembrowski, was on hand to testify in his favor. Surprisingly, Debbie’s name also appeared in the lineup for potential testifiers, though she was actually on Amber’s side to testify against her brother. However, nothing was said about her involvement in the case again, and the public never really knew whether she was allowed to testify.</p><p>With that said, we must acknowledge the fact that the case has been lost and won, with Jonny on the winning side and Amber on the losing side. This time, the show was on the other foot. Amber had to pay her ex the sum of $10 million.</p><h3><strong>Debbie Depp and Jonny Depp Don’t Share a Great Family Bond</strong></h3><p>From what is obvious, the relationship between Debbie Depp and her half-brother, Johnny, is far from cordial. Fans have reasoned that the siblings cannot be on good terms and Debbie would come out to testify against Johnny. in the law court</p><p>Apart from that, reports also revealed that the two siblings have always been at loggerheads. Following the death of their mother, Betty Sue Palmers, Johnny wasted no time in kicking his older sister out of their home, reports said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqmsdNmm56akp6ybrDEqadmop%2Bdu6%2FFjJ2cqaijYsCqv9OeqWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

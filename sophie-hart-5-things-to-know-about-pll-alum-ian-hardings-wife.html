Though the pair have occasionally appeared on red carpets together, they’ve largely kept their relationship private.</p><p>“I enjoy performing, but I don’t actually like everything else that comes with it, like the need to constantly put yourself out there on social media,” the Odd Birds author told <a href=#>Ability</a> magazine in 2020. “I still get weird looks if I’m at a party and someone says, ‘Oh, we’re going to take a photo.’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah, I don’t really want to take any photos.’ … It’s fun to be in front of a camera, but I never want to see the end product.”</p><p>Hart, for her part, seems to prefer being behind the camera too, so long as she’s the person taking the pictures. “She surprises me every day,” the Ford v Ferrari star told <a href=#>MyDomaine</a> in 2018.</p><p>Though Harding was in a relationship with Hart for most of PLL‘s run, some fans <a href=#>held out hope for a real-life romance</a> between him and his on-screen girlfriend, <a href=#><strong>Lucy Hale</strong></a>, but both parties maintained that things would only ever be platonic between them.</p><p>“Ian is a doll. He is the coolest guy in the world,” <a href=#>the Katy Keene alum told Seventeen</a> in 2011. “So funny. And I feel like our chemistry works so well. People are rooting for us to date, but it will never happen. He’s literally like a brother to me!” She did, however, admit to having a crush on him during season 1 of the show.</p><p>Since PLL ended in 2017, Harding and Hart have settled into their life in Los Angeles, where they share a home with their two Labradoodles, Mochi and Bailey.</p><p>“I wanted to live in an area that was tucked away,” the lupus advocate told MyDomaine of the couple’s home, which is located in a quiet canyon. “I didn’t want to hear any cars. I wanted to see birds and trees, so the canyon made the most sense.”</p><p>Harding, who’s also an avid bird watcher, also needed a place where he could encounter wildlife. “I had notebooks full of drawings of [birds] that I copied out of an Audubon field guide,” <a href=#>the actor wrote in his 2017 memoir</a>. “And in second grade, I once threw a tantrum when my science project group wanted to build a model volcano instead of a bird feeder.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to find out more about Hart:</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Usmagazine.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toq5%2BltaqxjKGYq6xdanq1tMinnqxlpKR6rLrOsGSamp%2BqwW68y6VkmqSlonqqrc1mn5qqlJ67qL%2BMsKCfnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

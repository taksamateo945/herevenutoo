"PG-13 is both, which is why sources familiar with Philly's strategy say he is the team's plan A in free agency."</p><p>In addition, he pointed back to previous reporting that Philly is believed to have a "real chance" of signing George.</p><p>The nine-time All-Star could choose to stay in Southern California, with the Los Angeles Clippers so far having failed to win the championship they coveted from the moment they added he and Kawhi Leonard.</p><p>However, there appears to be a very real divide between the two parties over money.</p><p>Leonard already pledged his future to the franchise with a <a href=# rel=noopener>three-year, $149.7 million</a> extension, which was significantly lower than he could've earned on a full max ($223 million over four years).</p><p>The deal was also notable in what it might mean for George.</p><p>"Rival teams and agents are conducting business, sources said, under the impression the Clippers aren't keen on committing to guaranteed money beyond the three-year window of Leonard's deal that runs through 2026-27," Yahoo Sports' <a href=# rel=noopener>Jake Fischer</a> reported last Thursday.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Spotrac</a> projects the Sixers to have $55.5 million in practical salary cap space and they could have as much as $72.8 million to spend. Philly can sign George or another marquee free agent outright.</p><p>The 34-year-old is not only one of the best players on the board but also somebody who should fit nicely alongside Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey. His versatility extends to where he can play on the floor because he can be a No. 1 scorer, a playmaker or a more complementary off-ball shooter depending on what the circumstances dictate.</p><p>For his career, George is averaging 20.8 points and 3.7 assists and he's a 38.5 percent three-point shooter.</p><p>No deal of this magnitude is without risk, and in the case of George, his durability has been a persistent concern. He only missed eight games in 2023-24 but failed to hit 60 games played in any of the four preceding campaigns.</p><p>But it's hard to picture a better upgrade for the Sixers that's realistically possible this offseason.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmeDeYCMqZiupF2csrC%2Bxp5kq62dpL%2B0ecKloKmolafAbr%2FTmqlmoaNihHex0axkqaSRo3qiecinZGtoYml6r67AZp2rnZVirqixzZyw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

In Britain, where&nbsp;few homes have air conditioning, the highest temperature has also reached nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit, falling just below the national record.</p><p>Firefighters operate at the site of a wildfire in Pumarejo de Tera near Zamora, northern Spain, on June 18, 2022.</p><p>Cesar Manso | AFP | Getty Images</p><p>At least five countries in Europe have declared states of emergency or red warnings as wildfires, fueled by the hot conditions, burn across France, Greece, Portugal and Spain. In the past week, more than 31,000 people have been displaced from their homes because of blazes in the Gironde region of Southwestern&nbsp;France.</p><p>Climate change has made heat waves and droughts more common, intense and widespread. Dry and hot conditions also exacerbate wildfires, which have grown more destructive in recent years.&nbsp;And lower nighttime temperatures that typically provide critical relief from the hot days <a href=#>are disappearing as the Earth warms.</a></p><p>Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain said Monday that he had visited areas impacted by wildfires in the western region of Extremadura. “Climate change kills people, our ecosystem and what is most precious to us,” Sánchez said.</p><p>Tourists fill the Levante beach in Benidorm to quench high temperatures as a heatwave sweeps across Spain on July 16, 2022 in Benidorm, Spain.&nbsp;</p><p>Zowy Voeten | Getty Images</p><p>At least 350 people have died in Spain from high temperatures during the past week, according to estimates by Spain’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Carlos III Health Institute</a>.

The UK Met Office, for the first time ever, issued a red warning for heat, its most extreme alert.

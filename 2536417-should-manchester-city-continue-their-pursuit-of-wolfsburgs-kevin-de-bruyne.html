The Ivory Coast and Spain internationals have combined for 49 goals and 33 assists in the Premier League since 2013/14, but now 32 and 29 years old respectively, City could be looking for long-term security in central attacking midfield.</p><p>De Bruyne would seem an ideal candidate for the Sky Blues' next "No. 10."</p><img alt="One of the best midfield combinations, David Silva and Yaya Toure are nearing their end." src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/169/640/ab2f56d406f462da6fe301de11e0ab1e_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/169/640/ab2f56d406f462da6fe301de11e0ab1e_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption>One of the best midfield combinations, David Silva and Yaya Toure are nearing their end.</span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Alex Livesey/Getty Images</span><p>2014/15 was a tremendous season for the 24-year-old midfielder.&nbsp;Given a central, creative role with little responsibility in terms of defending, the Belgian international took Germany by storm. Ten goals and 20 assists in the Bundesliga have no doubt inflated Wolfsburg's original investment into the tens of millions.</p><p>Bought from <a href=#>Chelsea</a> for £18 million in the 2014 January transfer window, De Bruyne's stock has reached astronomical levels, and the evidence is clear to anyone who watches him play. Vision, pace, awareness, technical ability and an all-important footballing brain are his foremost traits—traits that Man City need in their aging squad.</p><p>There are two hiccups to this rumoured transfer, though.</p><p>The first is UEFA financial fair play regulations. Not since the 2009/10 season have Sir Alex Ferguson's "noisy neighbours" spent over £100 million in one term. Yet, they were still given harsh punishments by UEFA's regulators, meaning last season they were handcuffed.</p><img alt="Is another £50 million invested in Manchester City's attack a crucial need this summer?" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/169/641/b56dc0816ac13b70fab88b600eb522e4_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/169/641/b56dc0816ac13b70fab88b600eb522e4_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption>Is another £50 million invested in Manchester City's attack a crucial need this summer?</span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Boris Streubel/Getty Images</span><p>This season, however, City should have the&nbsp;financial wherewithal to spend in copious amounts on select footballers, but they might regret not disbursing their funds in a more calculated fashion—specifically locating world-class defenders.</p><p>Of course, De Bruyne would be a fantastic addition at the Etihad, but he would also be a great piece anywhere. What Pellegrini and the City Football Group must ask themselves is: "Can we last another season with Toure and Silva as our main central attacking options?"</p><p>If the answer is yes, they could try to convince De Bruyne and Wolfsburg to wait another year—continuing his development in a smaller Bundesliga pond before making his big-money move to Manchester's ocean in summer 2016.</p><p>If the answer is no—attempting to beat other potential suitors, primarily local rivals <a href=#>Manchester United</a>—the English champions once removed could pull the trigger on the blossomed Belgian, placing all their proverbial eggs in the £100 million De Bruyne/Sterling basket.</p><img alt="Is Kevin De Bruyne willing to leave the security of Germany and risk another English rollercoaster?" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/169/642/b537f6ee3fb7bfa83147c32701ed5fc2_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/169/642/b537f6ee3fb7bfa83147c32701ed5fc2_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption>Is Kevin De Bruyne willing to leave the security of Germany and risk another English rollercoaster?</span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>David Rogers/Getty Images</span><p>Manchester City's second hiccup is De Bruyne's personal ambitions.</p><p>A conceivable scenario is the Citizens offering £60 million for the midfielder, Wolfsburg accepting (as how could they not), but De Bruyne electing to stay in Germany.</p><p>After a torrid and largely tumultuous career (or lack thereof) with Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, there seems every possibility the 24-year-old is enjoying being&nbsp;Die Wolfe's main man and does not feel like risking an English bench.&nbsp;Furthermore, securing 2015/16 Champions League football with his German outfit, De Bruyne might bail at the wrong time on&nbsp;Dieter Hecking's promising Wolfsburg project.</p><p>Man City's desperation can play out in numerous ways, but if they are truly intent on giving Pellegrini another chance to prove himself, they must be willing to spend.</p><img alt="If Manchester City are intent on making a run for trophies this season, Kevin De Bruyne is a magnificent target." src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/169/643/3f2a4f33a472c0b1842cf0e8efc996f3_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/169/643/3f2a4f33a472c0b1842cf0e8efc996f3_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption>If Manchester City are intent on making a run for trophies this season, Kevin De Bruyne is a magnificent target.</span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Boris Streubel/Getty Images</span><p>Whether De Bruyne is a player they need at the moment is up for debate, but City will undoubtedly need a player with his skill set and overall quality in the near future.</p><p>Paying £50 million for a young 20-something (who only has one year to justify the fee) is a roll of football's dubious&nbsp;dice, but it is a gamble the Citizens have already made once this summer.</p><p>"If once is good, is twice better?"</p><p>They&nbsp;must ask.</p><p>They must answer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW5rZml%2BeHnSoaaupJRiuqK6wqGcrKyVp3qktdOyZJynnqm2r8HEZquhnZmnerHB0aysoqxdpLNuw86lnayapae0tHnKnq2ipl2Zsm6u0a6wp50%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

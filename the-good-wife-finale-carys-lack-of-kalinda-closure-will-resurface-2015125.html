The Good Wife said goodbye to beloved character Kalinda (<strong>Archie Panjabi</strong>) on <a href=#>May 10’s emotional season 6 finale</a>, and as series costar <strong>Matt Czuchry</strong> explained to <a href=#><strong>HuffPost Live</strong></a> Monday, Kalinda<strong>‘</strong>s exit will continue to cause waves throughout season 7.</p><p>Choosing to say goodbye to Florrick, Agos, and Associates on Sunday’s show, Best Supporting Actress Emmy winner Panjabi’s character Kalinda Sharma breezed past Cary (Czuchry), without so much as a word for her former lover and coworker.</p><p>With Kalinda out of the picture, Cary will have the opportunity to spread his wings, according to the actor who portrays him.</p><p>“The good thing about that is that . . . Cary and Kalinda have had a strong friendship over 100-plus episodes, so that lack of closure is going to come into play in season 7,” Czuchry told <strong>HuffPost Live</strong>. “It would be interesting to see Cary with somebody else. Oftentimes we jump in relationships too soon after getting out of them, and it’d be interesting to see him to muddle through another relationship because he didn’t get closure with Kalinda.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>In the meantime, Czuchry, 37, is spending his hiatus indulging the fans of one of his beloved former shows: Gilmore Girls.

Spencer, 54, shared a picture of herself posing on the sand in a black cut-out swimsuit, her beloved pup by her side. "Feeling good, Louis!" she captioned the post. "Happy New Year Lara. You look absolutely beautiful," a fan commented. Spencer seems to be getting fitter with every year that passes—here's how she stays happy, and why she calls herself a jock.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/shutterstock_524464960.jpg><p><span>Spencer starts her day before dawn, arriving at work around 5am, which is where she eats breakfast. "I usually have eggs and a grapefruit, but believe me, there's a huge tray of muffins that call my name every day!" </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she tells </span><i><span>Greenwich</span></i><span> magazine</span></a><span>. "For beauty, I do yoga once or twice a week. I play tennis a lot—about three times a week—and I run around like a lunatic and never sit down. I have really ridiculous energy. I try to eat well but don't deny myself delicious things."</span></p><p><span>Spencer loves thrift store shopping for hidden gems. "If you judge the book by its cover, then you won't bring anything home, because most of the stuff is like a girl badly in need of a makeover," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she tells </span><i><span>Out</span></i></a><span>. "The number one thing that I look for is good bones, and by that I mean classic lines, quality construction, designers' marks–in terms of labels–some clue to see if it's a designer I like. I look for pieces that make me smile. I trust my gut–if I'm looking at a vintage oil painting, it doesn't matter to me whether that artist is well-known. It just matters whether I find beauty in that picture. And it doesn't matter if it's $5 or $500, if it makes you feel good, and you think it will brighten up your world and help create your personal space, then go for it."</span></p><p><span>Spencer loves her shelter pups, and rescued them after hearing about trucks of dogs being taken out of New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. "I adopted them after Hurricane Katrina," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she tells </span><i><span>Greenwich</span></i><span> magazine</span></a><span>. "There's not a dog I meet that I'm not in love with. The weirder looking, the better. I love the offbeat—in everything, really. Harry is a golden-doodle and Dandy is a Lhasa apso–Shih Tzu–German shepherd… I did a story for </span><i><span>GMA</span></i><span> on dog DNA testing—that's how I found out."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Spencer has a unique approach to decorating. "I love a house that has different feels and different looks," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><i><span>she tells Out</span></i></a><span>. "Great designers will tell you that symmetry and scale are everything, and it's true. As you're looking at a room, it should feel restful to your eyes. You can do that by using pairs of things, or make sure that your coffee table isn't tiny next to a big, cozy sofa. Make sure all the sizes feel right together. Listen, hats off to people go to school for this, and the great decorators of the world–I'm not saying that I could do what they do–But I was taught, I approach interior decorating by trusting my gut, my intuition, and my personal style. Don't worry about what's in or what's out, worry about what's right for you."</span></p><p><span>Spencer is a former Penn State diver. "I'm a big jock," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she tells </span><i><span>Greenwich</span></i><span> magazine</span></a><span>. "I had a great twisting one-and-a-half. My dread was the reverse two-and-a-half, because you're moving forward off the board and then spinning back toward it head first. I broke my hand in four places doing it. I still get nervous every day—it's live TV—but I know I've got this. With that dive, I never got past the thumping heart, where I was like, 'Get it together! Get it together!' I loved diving, though. It was a huge educator in life in general. I'm a huge advocate of sports. My mom plugged me into everything because I was the youngest of five and she didn't know what to do with me. It was a very happy accident."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK2t0ZpkrKiVo7Cmvoysq66mo2K2r3nSsKCmq6WewW6yxJ6joqaXYrSwu8No</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

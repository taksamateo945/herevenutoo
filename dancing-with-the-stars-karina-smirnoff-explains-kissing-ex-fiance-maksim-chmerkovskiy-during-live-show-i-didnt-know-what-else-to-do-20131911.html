Chmerkovskiy, 33, used to be a pro on the show, and, despite a&nbsp;<a href=#>somewhat heated exit from the show in 2012</a>, returned on Nov. 18 to be a guest judge. The seasoned dancers were engaged from December 2008 to September 2009 before amicably splitting.&nbsp;</p><p>So Smirnoff was clearly anxious to dance in front of her ex on Monday night. But the Ukrainian performer had nothing to worry about. Chmerkovskiy gave her high marks on both performances, and following her second dance — the rumba — he had some especially kind words&nbsp;</p><p>“I think you have a huge advantage in this competition,” he said to Bleu. “You have what I consider to be Top 5 best female dancers of all time.”</p><p>Touched by her ex’s words, Smirnoff left Bleu’s side and ran up to the judge’s table to give Chmerkovskiy a kiss on the cheek. After the show, she explained her actions to Us Weekly.</p><p>“He had such a sweet comment, and I didn’t know what else to do,” she said. “I was like, that’s so sweet. Should I give him a kiss?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>And Smirnoff had a critique of her own for her former flame.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think he did a great job,” she said. “He had a lot of constructive criticism because he has been on both sides now, as a judge and as a dancer, and he knows how much work we put in every week getting the dances ready. I think he did a great job, and I was pleasantly surprised with that comment, but Maks is always full of surprises!”</p><p>Smirnoff dated her DWTS season 6 partner <strong><a href=#>Mario Lopez</a></strong> from 2006 to 2008, and after Chmerkovskiy, she was engaged to MLB pitcher <strong>Brad Penny</strong> until 2011 when the couple ended the engagement.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Chmerkovskiy is currently dating Sport’s Illustrated model <strong><a href=#>Kate Upton</a></strong>, and recently talked to Us about the blond bombshell.&nbsp;</p><p>“She’s an amazing person,” he told Us. “We have an incredible time together, and, you know, I definitely didn’t see that coming and I think neither did she.”</p><p>Chmerkovskiy isn’t the first former pro to return to guest judge this season. Dancer-turned-actress <strong><a href=#>Julianne Hough</a></strong> caused quite a stir on the show when she gave a <a href=#>controversial critique of since-eliminated pro <strong>Mark Ballas</strong></a> in early October.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOnZinm5mjtG7DyK2fZqyYmnq0wMCrqmajkae2r62MrKSiqp6ks6d5xLGnpZmZo8But8isqqKml2KyuXnFopinm5ViuqK30qKkZpuYorKzt86vqqShqWKxtr7Ip55mpJmrsm6%2Fx6iuZqFdmbalutNmoqenp2LEqa3TZpylq5ViwbB5w6hka2hhaH56fZA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

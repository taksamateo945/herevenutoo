The article, titled “If You’re Woke, You Dig It,” discussed the “<a href=#>shifting street slang used in urban African-American communities</a>.”</p><p>Because of the word’s origin as a slang term, Oxford&nbsp;has very little evidence of the word being written before the 2000s. The only other example appears in the 1972 play “Garvey Lives” by Barry Beckham.</p><p>“Because of the term’s prominence in today’s popular culture, as well as the role it seems to have played in the 1960s and ’70s, the OED Appeals Program [isn’t] currently seeing any contextual evidence of ‘woke’ meaning ‘well informed’ or ‘alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice’ that dates from earlier than 2008,” Oxford said.</p><p>The word has since been added to the Oxford website and will be listed in the upcoming print addition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX54e49vZmtwX6jBosWMsKaknV2kxae70Z1knaGTqbawusCrsGaZlJnAbsDEq6Rmm5Gprq27xmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Photosport</p><p>Live updates of the All Blacks’ clash against the USA at FedEx Field in Washington DC – kick-off at 8am Sunday (NZT).</p><p>Sam Cane will play his first test of the season when the All Blacks face the United States on Saturday, although it won’t be as captain.</p><p>Lock Sam Whitelock will lead New Zealand in its first match in America for seven years while Cane will be on the bench as he makes his return from a serious injury.</p><p>The team named Thursday by head coach Ian Foster is composed mostly of players who missed or had little playing time in the recent Rugby Championship in Australia. Whitelock chose to sit out New Zealand’s Championship matches in Australia to be with his wife, who recently gave birth.</p><p>He will lead the All Blacks in all of the tests on their northern tour against the United States, Wales, Italy, Ireland and France as Cane focuses on his return. Cane became New Zealand’s regular captain when Kieran Read retired after the 2019 World Cup but missed the Rugby Championship and previous tests against Australia, Tonga and Fiji because of a torn pectoral muscle.</p><p>He will be joined on the bench by lock Josh Lord who has been named to make his debut as a replacement. Lord was called up after Scott Barrett and Patrick Tuipulotu returned to New Zealand at the end of the Rugby Championship.</p><p>Hooker Dane Coles, who missed the Championship because of a calf muscle injury, is also named on the bench.</p><p>Richie Mo’unga missed most of the Australian leg of the Rugby Championship while awaiting the birth of his second child, and will start at first five-eighth on Saturday. He joined the All Blacks in Australia in time to be on the bench for the final match against the Springboks.</p><p>Mo’unga will combine with Scotland-born halfback Finlay Christie, who will start a test for the first time. Braydon Ennor will also start for the first time at centre, as will Ethan de Groot at loosehead prop.</p><p>“Finlay has made the most of his opportunities and he just keeps growing his game and getting better and better and we’re delighted at how he’s going,” Foster said. “Braydon has had a year disrupted by injury but he’s back.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-sport">Related articles</h2><p>“He’s running fast and we’re again looking forward to seeing how he goes.”</p><p>Foster has named a strong attacking back three with Damian McKenzie at fullback and Will Jordan and George Bridge on the wings. Ennor will combine in midfield with Quinn Tupaea.</p><p>Luke Jacobson, Dalton Papalii and Hoskins Sotutu will form a powerful back row, likely to feature Cane later in the match.</p><p>The bench is particularly strong with Cane, Coles, halfback TJ Perenara, first-five Beauden Barrett and centre Anton Lienert-Brown.</p><p>Saturday’s match at FedEx Field — normally the home of the NFL’s Washington Football Team — is the fifth official test between New Zealand and the United States, the first since their 2014 meeting in Chicago.</p><p>“The chance for us to play in a new city and new stadium is pretty special and the group is really excited and looking forward to the occasion,” Foster said. “It’s time to get back into our groove after our break in Australia and with a number of players having not played for a while. It’s time to get our game going again and we are ready to go.”</p><p>Centre Bryce Campbell will captain an Eagles team much changed from the one which was beaten 34-15 by Uruguay in a World Cup qualifying match earlier this month. Only five members of that starting 15 remain.</p><p>Ireland-born No 10 Luke Carty and halfback Nate Augspurger, who started on the bench against Uruguay, will now combine in the starting lineup.</p><p>Three players are in line for test debuts. Ryan James will start on the right wing in his first test while Chad Gough and Faka’osi Pifeleti likely will make their debuts from the bench. Pifeleti is the younger brother of established Eagles player Kapeli Pifeleti.</p><p>South Africa-born head coach Gary Gold expects a much better performance from the Eagles than they produced again Ururguay.</p><p>“Facing the No 2 team in the world is an incredible challenge for anyone and, as we’ve said many times, these are the high-pressure situations we want to put ourselves in,” Gold said. “Matches like these can be a true test of character as they force split-second decisions in intense and hectic environments. This is an exciting opportunity for us to expose our younger players to the best in the world while allowing our experienced guys to be leaders and help guide the cohesion of the group.”</p><p><i>– AP</i></p><h2 class=article__heading>Teams</h2><p><strong>All Blacks:</strong> Damian McKenzie, Will Jordan, Braydon Ennor, Quinn Tupaea, George Bridge, Richie Mo’unga, Finlay Christie; Hoskins Sotutu, Dalton Papalii, Luke Jacobson, Tupou Vaa’i, Sam Whitelock (captain), Angus Ta’avao, Asafo Aumua, Ethan de Groot.</p><p><strong>Reserves:</strong> Dane Coles, George Bower, Tyrel Lomax, Josh Lord, Sam Cane, T.J.

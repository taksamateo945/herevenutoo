I already put my makeup on twice today: I put it on to take my kid to school, and then I went home, washed my face, and put it on again to have lunch with you,” she tells the writer.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="gwen stefani harpers" width=467 height=564 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Stefani even wears makeup at home because “I like to make my husband like me more,” she says of singer/songwriter <strong>Gavin Rossdale</strong>, 46. “And he likes it when I’m wearing makeup.”</p><p>Though she’s known for her six-pack abs, Stefani admits that she hates “talking about my body. It’s ridiculous. There is no secret: You just have to eat healthy, work out and torture yourself!”</p><p>Stefani hits the gym as much as possible, she adds, “but it’s more for my brain than it is for my body.” It doesn’t hurt, however, that constant exercise keeps her at a sample-size. “I like to wear clothes too much, so I try to keep focused,” Stefani explains.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="gwen stefani harpers" width=467 height=581 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The “Settle Down” singer — mom to sons <strong>Kingston</strong>, 6, and <strong>Zuma</strong>, nearly 4 — admits that while it’s “super fun being a mom,” it’s not always easy. “Finding that balance between work and family is the hardest thing I’ve ever done,” she tells <a href=#>Harper’s Bazaar</a>. “By far.”</p><p>A showbiz veteran, the rocker tells the magazine she’s grown a thick skin over the years. “That someone would say something untrue or bad about me doesn’t bother me. It’s like water off a duck’s back,” she says. “None of that stuff matters. There’s something in me, being this passive person, that those kinds of things don’t upset me. I know they can say anything; they can just make something up. But what are you going to do? It’s not part of my reality, so it’s okay.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ6wnZ5iwLWxxZqlomWYqsCjrc2dZKCZpp67br7OrKqdmZyaeq21yp6qZqWVYrqwvsRmrqKsmGK6orfErqdmamBmf3iE</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

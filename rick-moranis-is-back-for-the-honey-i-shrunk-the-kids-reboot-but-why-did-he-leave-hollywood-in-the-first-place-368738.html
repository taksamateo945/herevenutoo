The beloved actor and comedian has been trending on Twitter ever since the news broke, but why did he walk away from Hollywood in the first place?</p><p>Moranis made incredible movies in the 1980s and 1990s, and to this day it‚Äôs difficult to find a college student who doesn‚Äôt have Spaceballs, the original Ghostbusters, and Strange Brew in their media library.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The entire internet's reaction to the return of <a href=# rel=nofollow>#RickMoranis</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/L1SK6cV4pT</a></p><p>‚Äî Ella Zee üåàüëë (@EllaZee5) <a href=# rel=nofollow>February 12, 2020</a></p><p>The SCTV alum also starred in the classic comedy My Blue Heaven, The Flintstones, Little Shop of Horrors, and Little Giants. But, after 1996‚Äôs Big Bully, Moranis walked away from Hollywood and hasn‚Äôt appeared in a movie since.</p><p>Moranis ‚Äì who is now 66 ‚Äì decided to put his career on hold after his wife, costume designer Ann Belsky, died of breast cancer in February 1991. He told The Hollywood Reporter in 2015 that he took a break ‚Äì which turned into a longer break ‚Äì to take care of his children, Rachel and Mitchell.</p><p>Moranis says he never actually retired, and he‚Äôs still interested in working on projects that he finds interesting.</p><p>‚ÄúI still get the occasional query about a film or television role and as soon as one comes along that piques my interest,‚Äù he said at the time. ‚ÄúStuff happens to people all the time, and people make adjustments, change careers, move to another city. Really, that‚Äôs all I did.‚Äù</p><p>https://twitter.com/ThemedReality/status/1227716625689743360</p><p>Moranis explained that he was working with really interesting and wonderful people, but he went from that to being at home with a couple of little kids. Even though it was a very different lifestyle, Moranis said it was important to him and he has ‚Äúabsolutely no regrets‚Äù because his ‚Äúlife is wonderful.‚Äù</p><p>Moranis admitted that he is ‚Äúpicky‚Äù about the projects that he says yes to, but he will continue to be picky because it has worked well for him. He opted not to take part in the Ghostbusters reboot in 2016, even though Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, and Sigourney Weaver did.</p><p>‚ÄúI hope it‚Äôs terrific,‚Äù Moranis said before the movie was released. ‚ÄúBut it just makes no sense to me. Why would I do just one day of shooting on something I did 30 years ago?‚Äù</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Rick Moranis will star alongside Josh Gad for the Honey, I Shrunk The Kids reboot titled Shrunk, but Disney has not yet revealed when it will hit theaters.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinrCsecyoqZqmmah6qr%2BMm5ico12bvLN506GcZqCfo7K6echmqqGqpaO4bsDHnmSkoZSoerOxwaimrWWSqsFuw8eyZJ2hlGK1pnnLnpivnV2dvK242LCmqJxdnrtuwMeeZJ%2BhoqjBbrzLmpqeZWNrhXh%2Fl2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

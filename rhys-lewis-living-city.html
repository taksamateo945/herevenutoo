It&nbsp;perfectly captures the two sides of city life; the lonely, vulnerable side, and the thrilling, expect-the-unexpected side.The chorus has an euphoric feel to it, complete with a gospel choir.</p><p>Talking about the track, Rhys says, “This song is pretty self-explanatory from the lyrics, but in a nutshell it’s about the bittersweetness of living… in the city. It takes so much energy to live in a city. It’s expensive, relentless, busy, lonely at times, and tiring. Just getting on London’s tube at rush hour can make you want to sell all your possessions and move to the middle of nowhere.</p><p>“But at the same time, it’s exciting and unpredictable, spontaneous, full of opportunities and over-populated with interesting people. And the more you give, the more you get back. Every time I think about leaving, I remind myself of all the things this place has given me. And there’s an unspoken promise from the city that is: it always has more to give.”</p><p>‘Living In The City’ follows on from Rhys’ debut offering, ‘Waking Up Without You’, which garnered incredible success. Racking up over 170,000 streams in two weeks, it shot to the top of Spotify’s Viral Chart.</p><p>Having signed to Decca Records, 2017 looks set to catapult Rhys to even greater heights. The singer will perform at London’s Borderline on March 30. If you fancy catching Rhys in action then you better be quick&nbsp;– his last headline show at London’s Servant Jazz Quarters sold out in just 48 hours. We fell in love with Rhys and his golden vocals at <a href=#>BST Hyde Park</a> last summer, so we definitely recommend that you go and&nbsp;see him live!</p><p>We can also expect an album from Rhys in Summer 2017. Spending the past year between studios in London, Nashville, Stockholm, LA and Berlin, Rhys has honed his craft to perfection and is ready to share more of his emotive music with the world.</p><p>Keep up to date with Rhys Lewis on social media: <a href=#>Facebook</a> | <a href=#>Instagram</a> | <a href=#>Twitter</a></p><p>‘Living In The City’ is available&nbsp;to <a href=#>download</a> and <a href=#>stream</a> now.</p><h4>Share your thoughts on Rhys Lewis with us on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix</a></h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kv6nF0majnq%2BZqHqttdWipaBlk57Buns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

According to a new report, Kendall and Kylie Jenner are at odds over money, and the sisters can barely talk to each other.</p><p>“Kendall figures it’s crazy how much Kylie’s worth [an estimated $900M] while she’s only got a fraction of that [approx. $50M] in the bank herself,” an insider recently told Radar Online.</p><p>The source went on to say that Kendall and Kylie have nothing in common, and things really started to fall apart between them when Kylie launched her makeup line, and it turned out to be uber-successful.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BsOfwBwHBX1/</p><p>Apparently, there is so much envy between the sisters, it’s like they aren’t happy when the other is doing well, says the insider.</p><p>“Kylie really rubs it in, and it’s been a big issue lately because Kendall’s on the ascendency with her modeling. And that’s gotten Kylie looking over her shoulder.”</p><p>Back in 2017, Kylie didn’t show up for Kendall’s birthday bash, and in 2018 Kendall skipped out on the birth of Kylie’s daughter, Stormi. Now, insiders say that Kendall and Kylie’s relationship is “strictly business” since they do share the Kendall & Kylie clothing brand. And, even though they are both “impossibly spoiled” and have been rich their whole lives, a source insisted that the two never have enough, and their “greed knows no bounds.”</p><p>Kendall recently partnered with Proactiv and became the company spokesperson because of her acne. But this outraged fans because momager Kris Jenner had promised that her daughter would be telling a “raw story” that could help her fans.</p><p>The fact that the family considered Kendall’s battle with acne and partnership with Proactive a bombshell personal confession led to a ton of ridicule on social media, with fans calling it a “pathetic cry for attention.”</p><p>Kendall faced a backlash in the past when she appeared in a Pepsi commercial that many thought was “tone deaf.” And, Kim Kardashian has come under fire recently for plugging Flat Tummy Co shakes.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq5UZAfBgZ5/</p><p>Fans have slammed the family’s shameless self-promotion, and the ratings for Keeping Up With the Kardashians have taken a sharp downward turn this season.</p><p>One person called the entire Kardashian-Jenner family “truly disgusting,” and tweeted that Kris Jenner should be ashamed of herself for trying to hype such nonsense.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>New episodes of Keeping Up With the Kardashians featuring Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner air Sunday nights on E!.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebmrulrculZJqmlGK4urjInmSjnZ6jsrN5wK1ksJmiYsC2vMSrpKiclaF6qr%2BMq5ypp6KpsqW42GahnpmcpMK0ec6fZK2glWK5qryMpKCtZZ2ktLa40makmqujnsOmecWoqa2tnpp6c3%2BSaWlwZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

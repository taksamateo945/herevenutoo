"I think I'm good right now, but I don't know," the actress, 40, told<strong> <a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> at July 30's FLOWER Beauty & Eyewear Launch (with The Bouqs in attendance) in Los Angeles.</p><p>"The door's open, but I'm no spring chicken," Barrymore continued. "I have to figure it out sooner or later."</p><p>Barrymore married art consultant <strong>Will Kopelman</strong> in June 2012, and has since welcomed daughters Olive, 2, and Frankie, 15 months. "I feel like my life is in total abundance," the actress and entrepreneur told <strong>Us</strong> of her life as a family of four.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A famously unabashed wild child in her younger days, Barrymore says motherhood has totally transformed her. However, that's not to say she doesnâ€™t long for what used to be. "[I'm always surprised at] how intense of an internal battle it always is," she revealed of parenthood. "You will never be the same again. So trying to get back to your old self in any way, whether it's like, 'I'm back to work and I'll go back to the person I was at my office!' you're not the same. You're forever changed."</p><p>She added: "It's a new you and it's a new set of mountains to climb. But they're wonderful and I wouldn't trade them for anything."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJurnadir6K%2B0bKkqKqVYra0ecKopayhlJq%2FqrrGZp%2BarpmjtG6tjK2foqqUYq%2Birthmq6GdXZm8sL7SZqapnZ5if3F9lGxocA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

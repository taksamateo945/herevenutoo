I was surprised that the first one turned out as well as it did … we wanted to be respectful to that film and also to the people who liked that and make sure we didn’t just phone in a sequel,” Bateman told ABC News’ Cameron Mathison.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“Horrible Bosses,” a comedy, centered around three men who hated their bosses and hatched a plan to kill them. In the follow-up, the same three men – played by Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day – hatch an extreme plan to regain control of their company.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Aniston, who reprises her role as sex-addicted dentist Julia Harris, agreed, saying the cast “worked really hard.”</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Asked what it was like to return to the set, Aniston, who said she’s known Bateman for “20-plus years,” added that having that kind of “built-in friendship” with her co-stars made work easy.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bateman agreed. “Not a lot of work going on,” he said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">New to the franchise are Chris Pine and Christoph Waltz, who play a father-son duo in the film.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bateman said the cast was “pretty intimated” to be working with the newcomers, adding Pine and Waltz were funny because they didn’t try to be.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“They didn’t, like, talk loud and make faces like some people who don’t really do a lot of comedy sometimes will do,” he said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Asked what it was like to play a character like Harris, Aniston replied: "It ... goes against every fiber of my being. Yes, it's completely fun. It's a dream job for any actress to play that monster."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">As in “Horrible Bosses,” the language in the sequel does get raunchy.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Mathison asked Aniston whether it was hard for her to not smile as she delivered her lines.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">She said the cast usually gets the “giggles” out during rehearsal.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">As for how they keep a straight face during some of the scenes, Bateman says he distracts himself with “horrible thoughts,” such as bad things happening to his family or children.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">But that doesn’t always work.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“Inevitably I’ll think about them getting hurt doing a comedic pratfall and then I’ll start laughing. And so, it doesn’t really work,” he said. “And then I’ll just end up pinching myself off-camera.”</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">“Horrible Bosses: 2” opens on Nov. 26.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCRza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqGnoqe2o7jEZpmoq6OawG62xKelop6Vp3qiusisq6imXZ%2ButLvNZpmarJWirq951qipq6GVmXqttdWipaBno6m8s8Weopt2amdlfnODlnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

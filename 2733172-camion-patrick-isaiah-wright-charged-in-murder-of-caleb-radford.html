He appeared in 10 games for IU during the 2016 season, racking up 164 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns. He was granted a medical hardship in July following a series of injuries that ended his collegiate career.</p><p>Wright, a running back, transferred to the University of West Georgia from EMCC in February and took part in the Wolves' spring football practices.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Connor Tapp</a><span>&nbsp;</span>of 247Sports reported last month the West Georgia athletics department confirmed he was no longer enrolled at the school ahead of the 2017 season, however.</p><p>Patrick and Wright join Keshawn Lonnell Hopewell and Itiq Tivone Green as individuals charged in connection with the July stabbing, according to the<span>&nbsp;</span>Knoxville News Sentinel. The report added Radford was "stabbed multiple times," but no further information related to the case was released.</p><p>Jacobs noted Wright is in custody and is expected to get moved to Blount County Jail in Tennessee. Patrick is being held in Bloomington, Indiana, awaiting potential extradition to the same Tennessee facility as his brother. He's also been suspended by Indiana University.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXBrY2aEc3nCmqSip55ivaLA0aKapGWZqK6qrcdmrquhl53Bbq%2FHmqmgnZRitq95zK6pnZ2iYrynecKao56aXaeupbLOq5s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

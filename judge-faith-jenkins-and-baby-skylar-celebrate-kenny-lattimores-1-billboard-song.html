The new mom recently took to Instagram with their daughter, Skylar Leigh Lattimore, to celebrate her husband on his chart-topping song.</p><p>“There aren’t too many things that can get me out of my baby bubble these days but Kenny’s song becoming #1 in America on @billboard’s adult R&B chart is one of them,” Judge Faith said. I’m SO proud,” she exclaimed.</p><p>“Kenny is a master at staying focused, putting his head down, and working! And look at God,” the judge exclaimed. “We put this (and our baby) on our vision board — and I’ve now watched both birthed into reality!”</p><p>This year is <a href=# rel=noopener>turning out to be fantastic</a> for the Lattimores. It was just a few weeks ago that Kenny and Faith welcomed their baby girl. Skylar Leigh Lattimore was born to parents who were more than thrilled to meet her for the first time.</p><p>“Welcome to the world Skylar Leigh Lattimore,” Faith and Kenny shared with their social media fans. “And just like that life has taken on a whole new meaning,” the celebrity couple revealed.</p><p>Life began to <a href=# rel=noopener>take on new meaning</a> for the Lattimores last year. It was during the summer months that Faith and Kenny announced their expectancy of a child. The excited couple used the family dog to help spread the news.</p><p>“The last nine months you have supported me in all the ways I needed it most,” Faith told Kenny last month <a href=# rel=noopener>after giving birth</a>. “I watched you juggle a lot with your schedule and you somehow managed to balance it all,” the new mom shared with her husband.</p><p>“If Skylar ever wants to know what true love looks like, she will look no further than you,” Faith told Kenny.</p><p>Skylar is Faith Jenkins and Kenny Lattimore’s first child together. Kenny released his chart-topping single while preparing for her arrival. Fans of the R&B singer can stream the track on all major music platforms.</p><p>Photo: Judge Faith Jenkins/Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOo6ydn5Vis6K106Fko52eoLavv4yapZ1lkpavunnSpLClmaJisKa4xJupmqyVYrimus2yZKWZpKm2rrvRnqpmaV2Xtq24waiYq5xdqLyvs44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

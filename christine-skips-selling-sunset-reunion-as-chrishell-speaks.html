News</a> caught <a href=#><strong>Chrishell Stause</strong></a>&nbsp; not feeling so at ease after filming the special as she claimed many castmates made her out to be a “bully”</p><p>Chrishell took to her Instagram on Monday (right after the reunion was filmed) to set the record straight in her stories.</p><p>“I just wanted to address something real quick,” Chrishell said in her selfie video. “Every single season, I see this common thing every time that I’m actually, you know, not really nice, I’m fake nice and that I’m actually a bully or whatever.”</p><p>However, according to Chrishell that’s not the case at all, being a strong businesswoman and standing up for yourself does not equate to being labeled as “not friendly”</p><p>“Here’s the thing, to all the nice girls out there, listen, you try and be nice, you try and do the right thing. I’ve worked in this business a long time. I have kept so many friendships. I try and always be professional.”</p><p>Chrishell continued saying, “”At the end of the day, you don’t always have to be nice if somebody keeps pushing you and does not respect your boundaries and that is OK.”</p><p>Below are some photos from the Selling Sunset reunion.</p><p>The <a href=#><strong>Selling Sunset</strong> </a>season 5 reunion is set to debut on Friday May 5th and will be moderated by <strong>Queer Eye</strong> fashion guru, <strong>Tan France</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tom5intrTAyKecZqubnr20edKeo6Whnpx6tMHNrJytZaKawq%2B1zqdkmqtdmLWztdKhnKWkXai9pq3KrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

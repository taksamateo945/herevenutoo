That didn’t stop two terriers&nbsp;from protecting their California home from an unexpected intruder: a&nbsp;brown bear.</p><p>Deedee Mueller was taking a nap on Sunday when one of her dogs suddenly ran out of the room and started&nbsp;barking, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the&nbsp;Sacramento Bee&nbsp;reports.</a> The woman’s other dog, also a terrier, quickly followed after the first, also barking.</p><p>Mueller was unaware of it at the moment, but a brown bear had wandered into the house through an open door. Fortunately, the two dogs apparently scared off the larger animal.</p><p>The incident was caught on camera by Mueller’s security system. In the footage, which she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">uploaded to&nbsp;YouTube, </a>the bear can be seen entering the house through a backdoor (after taking a drink from one of the house’s fountains).</p><p>The bear slowly walks around the kitchen, spending a lot of time near the fridge. At one point, the bear appears to react to something off-camera and then exits the house.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Two small terriers fulfilled their duties as guard dogs by rushing at a bear that walked into their home in Pasadena, California, on April 10.<span class=credit>Deedee Mueller via Storyful</span></figure><p>The two dogs then appear and charge at the bear towards the exit. The bear then stands in the backyard for a second, looking back in on the house. Fortunately, the two terriers stood their ground and the bear decided to leave without a fight.</p><p>On YouTube, Mueller wrote, “Young bear visited our Pasadena hillside home and ventured into the house through open kitchen door. Our two small terriers Squirt and Mei Mei said NO.”</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Two small terriers fulfilled their duties as guard dogs by rushing at a bear that walked into their home in Pasadena, California, on April 10.<span class=credit>Deedee Mueller via Storyful</span></figure><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxno6KurbiMnaagq12YtaK%2FxGamn55dl7Kivoytn5qsXZe%2FsLfEZqCnrJ9isKK4yJ%2Bmq6aZlnqpu9SsnGavmJ65pnnOsKWeql2jrrG8xJ1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
